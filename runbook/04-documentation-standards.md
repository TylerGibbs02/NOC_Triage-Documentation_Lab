# Incident Documentation Standards

## Purpose
Ensure all tickets are concise, scannable, and suitable for handoff or audit.

---

## Required Ticket Structure

Every incident ticket must include:
- Summary
- Detection
- Impact
- Troubleshooting Performed
- Evidence
- Current Status
- Next Action

---

## Writing Rules

- Use bullet points only
- Timestamp all actions (UTC)
- Do not speculate
- Evidence before interpretation
- Avoid narrative paragraphs

---

## Example

### Good Summary
"Branch A offline due to WAN interface down"

### Poor Summary
"Users are having trouble accessing resources and the network might be down"

---

## Closure Requirements

Before closing an incident:
- Root cause documented
- Monitoring confirms recovery
- Stakeholders updated if required

---

## Documentation Principle
Tickets must allow another analyst to take over without verbal explanation.
